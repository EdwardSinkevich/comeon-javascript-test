# comeon-javascript-test

Simple applicant's test for Javascript coders.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment is to use Javascript and jQuery to tie together existing HTML and data to create a minimal, working casino website.

Basic HTML, CSS, images and JSON data is provided, however, feel free to impress by changing and enhancing any of these parts for an even better experience!

Your mission is to provide the Javascript code that makes the parts work as described, below.
The data is provided via jQueryâ€™s [$.ajax()](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) call, and feel free to use any other openly available library for
validation, templating, dependency injection, etc.

## Assignment criteria

We want to see how you approach and solve a problem, as well as look at code style and quality. Do take your time to do it right, rather than fast.
Extra effort to improve on the "website" will be noted. :)

While the test is primarily focused on Javascript, by all means use or change the HTML or CSS when that makes sense.

Be prepared to discuss your choices and code when delivered.

These parts needs all to be completed for the assignment to be complete:

### Login functionality

* Connect the login form to the /login ajax call.
* On valid username/password, transition to the games list screen.
* On invalid username/password, provide feedback and allow to try again.

### Games list screen

* List all games from the /games ajax call.
* Provide functionality for filtering by typing.
* Make it possible to start a game by clicking on the name or icon.

### Game play screen

* Load the selected game via the provided API
* Provide a way to go back to the Games list screen

## API

*TODO*

## Loading a game

We are loading an API from one of our providers (NetEnt) into the HTML template. Here's a simple example on how to load a game through their API:

```javascript
var config = {
	gameName: 'gonzos-quest.desktop',
	staticServer: 'https://comeon-static.casinomodule.com',
	gameServer: 'https://comeon-game.casinomodule.com',
	sessionId: 'DEMO-1234',
	targetElement: 'game',
	width: 800,
	height: 600
};

var success = function (netEntExtend) {
	netEntExtend.resize(640, 480);
};

var error = function (e) {
	console.error('Error loading game', e);
};

netent.launch(config, success, error);
```

Don't worry if it says the game is not currently available, loading the game is what counts.
width/height is optional, as is the example for resizing in the success callback. targetElement is a HTML id.
